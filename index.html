          <p>
            I am currently working through courses for the IBM Full Stack JavaScript Developer certification.
            I have worked on web development skills intermittently since 2002.
            In 2018, I completed a Udemy web development bootcamp and earned a certificate of completion.
            Presently, my long-term goal is to make a career transition into Full Stack Development. 
            I am a hobbyist user of various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Slackware.
            I have a working familiarity with the Linux command line, and have used it extensively to automate tasks.
            I also have familiarity with Microsoft Windows installation and configuration processes, and have previously taken a course 
            for CompTIA A+ certification.
